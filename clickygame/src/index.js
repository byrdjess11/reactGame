// Import is JSX syntax similar to require

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// Renders the app component that is imported from app.js to the element with id: "root"
// This root element can be found in the index.html public folder


// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA

serviceWorker.unregister();
